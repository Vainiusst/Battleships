# Battleships

A game I created for the VCS & KCS joint C# course as my final project.

The game is a classic Battleships game and the rules are implemented following the official rulebook by Hasbro.
The rules can be found here: https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/Battleship.PDF.

It is built using WPF as a GUI. The game features registration and logging-in mechanism that is connected to the Database. Besides users, the DB stores information about users' scores,
ranks, as well as their previous games' logs.

Currently the game lacks a bit more intelligent shooting mechanism on the Computer's part as it only shoots randomly, so it is really hard to lose. However, the improvements are in progress.
